"""Score route_run.ps1 results against the expectations from routes.py.

usage: python route_eval.py routes.json results.jsonl
stairs: PASS if the end height is at least low + min_rise and the player did not drop below the start floor;
        STUCK if it rose less; FALL if it ended more than 0.5 m below the ramp's low end.
door:   PASS if the end point is min_past metres beyond the door plane (dot with the plane normal) and this
        attempt opened it (prompt missing in older runs, or the recorded verb contains OPEN).
        UNOPENED if it is past the plane but the prompt was absent or was not OPEN: the leaf was already open.
        Otherwise NOPROMPT if the activation prompt was never seen, else BLOCKED.
A start more than 3 m off in X/Y, or more than 2 m off in Z, is UNREAD: the route was not begun.
A drop of more than 6 m after a matched start is FALL, including a door that opens onto the void.
Any other move no walk of this length could make is UNREAD.
Prints one line per route, a summary, and a door tally: both OPEN, one side, geometry, load failures.
Exit code 1 unless the file records results, every one is PASS, no load door was passed,
walked through, or fallen through, and no hinged pair is geometry (crossed with no recorded OPEN).
That exit does not mean every hinged door opened from both sides. A one-route file can exit 0.
