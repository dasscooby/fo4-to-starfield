# Research log

New findings go here (newest first). Each entry: question, method, evidence, **status**: verified /
supported hypothesis / unresolved. Older research lives in docs/JOURNAL.md and docs/spikes/; link, don't copy.

## 2026-10-09 Claude: which FO4 collision bodies are movable?
- Question: how does an FO4 `bhkPhysicsSystem` mark a body as movable (pushable), so the converter can stop turning
  physics objects into fixed obstacles (Vault 114 door `05C7DC` is blocked by a ragdoll skeleton)?
- Method: compared `SkeletonClothed01.nif` (ragdoll) with `SubPlatformWall01.nif` (static) in the
  `hknpPhysicsSystemData` packfile, then scanned all 4,014 converted models (local script, not in the repo).
- Evidence: body cinfo +12 (u32) is a motion index: skeleton bodies 0..16 with 17 motion entries and 16 constraints
  (`hkpRagdollConstraintData`, `hkpLimitedHingeConstraintData`), layer 10; static wall `0x7FFFFFFF`, layer 1.
- Scan (motion index != 0x7FFFFFFF): 490 models / 5,340 placements with one moving body; 59 / 345 with several and no
  joints (cryo pods, roof hatches); 29 / 167 ragdolls with joints (skeletons, V111 gear-room gates, gurney).
- Status: "+12 = motion index, 0x7FFFFFFF = static": **supported hypothesis** (2 files). "Motion index means
  pushable": **refuted as stated**: placed Statics like `BldgShellWoodStairsRailing01` also have one, so it also covers
  keyframed / animated bodies. **Unresolved:** the motion entries' mass / motion type, which separates pushable
  (dynamic) from keyframed bodies. Next: decode the motion cinfo array (system +32) and read inverse mass.

## 2026-10-09 Starfield `.af` animation header (door rigs)
- Question: what are the u16 fields at 0x28 of `open.af`?
- Method: compared four door families' `open.af` with their `characterassets\skeleton.rig` name tables
  (docs/spikes/WP-doors-research.md, "Header fields vs rig bone tables").
- Evidence: Akila 6 bones / field 6; generic 21/21; ship small 24/24; ship large 49/49.
- Status: field 2 = rig bone count: **verified** (4 of 4). Field 1 = format version: **supported hypothesis**.
  Field 3 = frame count: **supported hypothesis** (30 fps unconfirmed). Field 4: **unresolved**.

## 2026-10-09 FO4 precombine collision bodies with "shared vertex index out of range"
- Question: what primitive encoding do these `SCOL\CM*.NIF` bodies use?
- Evidence: 0 packed vertices, shared-index entries in triples (2130, start, x), primitives like (3,2,2,2);
  docs/JOURNAL.md "Precombine debris parts" and its correction.
- Status: **unresolved**. The "thin rods" reading was **refuted** (groups up to ~3 m in every axis).
