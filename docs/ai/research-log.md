# Research log

New findings go here (newest first). Each entry: question, method, evidence, **status**: verified /
supported hypothesis / unresolved. Older research lives in docs/JOURNAL.md and docs/spikes/; link, don't copy.

## 2026-10-09 Starfield `.af` animation header (door rigs)
- Question: what are the u16 fields at 0x28 of `open.af`?
- Method: compared four door families' `open.af` with their `characterassets\skeleton.rig` name tables
  (docs/spikes/WP-doors-research.md, "Header fields vs rig bone tables").
- Evidence: Akila 6 bones / field 6; generic 21/21; ship small 24/24; ship large 49/49.
- Status: field 2 = rig bone count: **verified** (4 of 4). Field 1 = format version: **supported hypothesis**.
  Field 3 = frame count: **supported hypothesis** (30 fps unconfirmed). Field 4: **unresolved**.

## 2026-10-09 FO4 precombine collision bodies with "shared vertex index out of range"
- Question: what primitive encoding do these `SCOL\CM*.NIF` bodies use?
- Evidence: 0 packed vertices, shared-index entries in triples (2130, start, x), primitives like (3,2,2,2);
  docs/JOURNAL.md "Precombine debris parts" and its correction.
- Status: **unresolved**. The "thin rods" reading was **refuted** (groups up to ~3 m in every axis).
