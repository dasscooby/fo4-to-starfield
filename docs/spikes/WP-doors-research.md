# Doors: how they animate in each game (research, 2026-10-08)

**Status: working** (2026-10-08). Hinged FO4 doors open and close in game. Turn it on with `convert_batch.py --starfield-data <Starfield Data>`, which needs the vanilla door body as a donor. Without it, doors stay static and walk-through.

## Fallout 4
Door NIFs (`meshes\SetDressing\Doors\*`, 28 sampled) carry their own keyframe animation:
`NiControllerManager` + `NiControllerSequence` ("Open" / "Close") + `NiMultiTargetTransformController` +
`NiTransformInterpolator`/`NiTransformData`, plus `NiTextKeyExtraData`. The moving part is a named node.

## Starfield
Door NIFs (520 in `Starfield - Meshes01.ba2`, 60 sampled) contain **no controller blocks**. They contain named nodes
(e.g. `AK_Door_Anim_02_Root`, `Hinge01_Point`, `REF_ATTACH_NODE`, `LookAtNode`) and `NiStringExtraData "sgoKeep"` tags on nodes
that must survive optimisation. The animation is attached by the **DOOR record** through an `AnimationGraphComponent`:

| Field | Example (`AK_Ext_Bld_WallA_DoorA_01_Alt02`, 0AA24A) |
|---|---|
| ANAM (graph) | `AnimTextData\Tables\Graphs\SimpleOpenClose01.agx` (shared by many doors) |
| BNAM (skeleton) | `architecture\city\akila\animated\doors\ak_ext_bld_walla_doora_01\characterassets\skeleton.rig` |
| CNAM (animations) | `architecture\city\akila\animated\doors\ak_ext_bld_walla_doora_01\animations` |

## Plan to make FO4 doors open
1. Pick a vanilla Starfield hinged door and a vanilla sliding door as templates.
2. Rebuild each FO4 door NIF as root -> `<template root node>` -> `Hinge01_Point` (placed at the FO4 animated node's pivot) ->
   geometry in the pivot's local space; tag nodes with `sgoKeep`.
3. Write a `DOOR` record with the template's `AnimationGraphComponent` (ANAM/BNAM/CNAM), open/close sounds and keywords.
4. Risk: the template's `.rig` / `.af` may encode the template's own hinge *position*, not only a rotation. Test in game; if the
   door jumps, the `.af`/`.rig` formats need decoding (no public spec known) or per-size template doors must be chosen.

## Attempt 1 (2026-10-08): rigged FO4 doors on the Akila template

Implemented:
- `nif.door_hinge` reads the node the FO4 `Open` sequence animates first (24 of the doors in our 8 cells are hinged).
- `convert_static.convert_door` and `sfnif.build_door_nif` rebuild the door as root > `AK_Door_Anim_02_Root` >
  `Hinge01_Point` (at the rig's hinge position, -0.823 / 1.698 / 0) > leaf geometry re-centred on the FO4 pivot, plus
  `REF_ATTACH_NODE` and `LookAtNode` (sgoKeep tags), a box body on the leaf, and the static frame under a `Frame` node.
- The plugin writes a `DOOR` record with the template's `AnimationGraphComponent`, real `OBND`, `SoundLevel` (DEVT) and
  `FacingAxisOverride` (trailing ANAM). The reference is shifted by `origin_offset` (door-local, rotated) so the door stays in
  its frame.

Verified in game (Hotel Rexford door 10AD60, `C:\Modding\research\s1\doortest.ps1`):
- The door sits exactly in its frame and shows **DOOR / Open (E)** ([screenshot](../media/door-rigged-prompt.jpg)).
- E toggles the state to Close and back, and the leaf body blocks the player.
- **The leaf never swings.**

What did not fix the swing: a `door` node (the rig's bone 2, child of the hinge), geometry directly on the hinge,
vanilla-like node order, `BSXFlags` 0xA, and record bounds, sound level and facing axis.

Clues:
- `skeleton.rig` is a plain bone table: 96-byte records (rotation, translation, parent index, name offset); bones are
  `AK_Door_Anim_02_Root`(-1) > `Hinge01_Point`(0) > `door`(1) > `REF_ATTACH_NODE`, `LookAtNode`, `C_..._Static_02`(2).
- FO4's rest pose for `BldWoodPDoor01` is **open**: its hinge node is rotated about 97 degrees, and the static conversion shows
  the leaf open ([screenshot](../media/door-static-restpose.jpg)). Every rigged build showed it **closed** at rest. So the
  graph probably does pose `Hinge01_Point` on load, and only the open transition does not show up.
- In the first build (`LookAtNode` directly under the hinge) the activation marker did swing aside when opened.
- With the vanilla door mesh on our record, or the vanilla DOOR 0AA24A placed in our cell, no prompt could be aimed at with
  scripted input. That test is still open.

Next: place vanilla DOOR 0AA24A somewhere easy to aim at, to confirm a vanilla door animates in our cell (lighting
template, cell flags). Then compare its node poses (`sgoKeep` nodes, open.af) with ours. Decoding `.af` is the fallback.
## Attempt 2 (2026-10-08)

- **A vanilla door animates in our cells.** With the vanilla DOOR `0AA24A` placed at the Rexford door spot
  (`FO4PORT_DOOR_BASE=0AA24A`, a PluginSpike test hook), E swings its leaf ([screenshot](../media/door-vanilla-swings.jpg)).
  So the cell, lighting and graph loading are fine, and the difference is in our NIF or our DOOR record.
- **Collision body.** Our leaf body was cloned from a static box. Diffing it against the vanilla leaf body (same 6,168-byte
  box layout) leaves only a few non-geometry words: 240 (2 vs 1, likely motion type), 232 and 264 (filter / flags), 448,
  456 and 472, and the mass block at 1064-1095. `sfcollision.keyframed()` copies those words from a donor (read from the
  user's install with `physics_blob_from_nif`, so no game data enters the repo). With a keyframed leaf the doorway became
  passable and the leaf rested in FO4's rest pose (swung about 97 degrees). I could not aim at it with scripted input to
  confirm a swing.
- **Record.** Vanilla records also carry `FLLD` (on the model), keywords, `NTRM` and open/close sounds. Not yet tested
  in isolation: aiming at a vanilla NIF placed with our record failed (the teleport landed inside a stall wall).

Next:
1. Build a dedicated door test cell: a floor, one door, the player spawned 1.5 m in front of it facing it. That removes
   the aiming problem.
2. Then test separately: vanilla NIF + our record, our NIF + the vanilla record (via an ESM copy), and the keyframed leaf.
3. Put the leaf in FO4's *closed* pose: the hinge rotation at the end of the FO4 `Close` sequence (NiTransformData), not
   its rest pose.

## Attempt 3 (2026-10-08): it works

A one-door test cell (`FO4PORT_DOORTEST=<door editor id>` in PluginSpike) holds a vanilla 8x8 m platform, the converted door,
vanilla door 0AA24A 3 m to the side, and a COC marker. With it, scripted aiming is no longer a problem.

**The fix was the keyframed leaf body** (`sfcollision.keyframed`). A body cloned from a static prop pins its node, so the
animation could not move the leaf.
- Test cell: the leaf swings open on E ([screenshot](../media/door-testcell-swing.jpg)).
- Hotel Rexford: the door is closed at rest, swings into the bathroom on E, and the player walks through
  ([screenshot](../media/door-rexford-opens.jpg)).

Known limits:
- The swing angle, direction and speed come from the Akila template, not from the FO4 door.
- The static frame part (`Frame` node) has no collision.
- Open/close sounds are not set.
- Sliding vault doors and elevators are excluded (`NOT_HINGED_RE`). They need a sliding template.
## Sliding doors (2026-10-08, offline research)

**Which vanilla graph do sliding doors use?** `SfInspect graphs` groups every Starfield `DOOR` by its
`AnimationGraphComponent`. 215 doors use `SimpleOpenClose01.agx`. That includes the hinged Akila door
*and* the sliding ship interior doors (`ShpGenIntPerSmWallMid_ExSm_Door01`, rig `ships\gen\interiors\animated\doors\...`).
The graph only sequences Open/Close; the motion comes from each door's own `skeleton.rig` + `animations\*.af`. So a sliding
FO4 door can be rigged exactly like the hinged ones: hang each FO4 moving part under the vanilla template node that moves the
same way, and reuse the template's ANAM/BNAM/CNAM.

**What the 8 passable FO4 doors do** (their FO4 `Open` sequence, end-pose keys, metres):

| FO4 model | moving nodes | motion |
|---|---|---|
| `VltDoorRes01A/B/C` (vault rooms) | `VaultDoorUpper`, `VaultDoorLower` (+ switches rotate) | upper +2.12 m up, lower -0.98 m down |
| `VltElevatorDoor02` | `Door01L`, `Door02R` | -0.80 / +0.80 m sideways |
| `VltElevatorDoorCarInt02` | `Door01L001`, `Door02R` | +0.91 / -0.91 m sideways |
| `UtilMetalElevatorOut01` | `Door` | rotation keys: actually hinged, try the hinged path |

**Template candidates (vanilla):**
- horizontal split: `ElvGen_ExSm_DoorFull01` (elevator, `SimpleOpenClose03_Load`) and `GenIntRmSmWallMid_DoorA00*`
  (generic interior, separate `panel01` / `panel02` NIFs).
- vertical split: Starfield ship interior doors (`ShpGenIntPerSmWallMid_*_Door01`), still to check which split vertically.

**Blocker:** the motion of each template node (direction, distance) is in the `.af` files, which aren't decoded. Either decode
`.af` (the FO4 side is already known exactly), or watch each template door open in game once (`FO4PORT_DOORTEST`-style test
cell) and read which node moves where. Distances will be the template's, not FO4's; a template whose panels open less than
the FO4 door would leave the doorway partly blocked, so measure the clear opening in game before accepting it.
Until then these doors stay passable and are listed as `door_not_opening` in the manifest.

**`.af` first look (Akila `open.af`, 218 bytes; `close.af` same size):** float 1.0 at 0x08; at 0x28 u16s 5, 6, 31, 2
(6 = bones in the rig, 31 = frames); at 0x48-0x5D a 16-entry keyframe-time table (frames 0,1,2,3,5,7,9,12,19,22,24,26,
27,28,29,30); 3-byte packed values from 0x60; from 0x90 one u32 per key whose low u16 runs smoothly
(0xC100, 0xC07F ... 0xC042, 0xC141, 0xC140). `close.af` has the same run reversed. It looks like a single quantized
rotation channel on `Hinge01_Point` (the hinge swing), the other channels constant. Sizes: elevator `open.af` is 848
bytes (more moving bones). Not decoded further. Watching each template open in game is cheaper and gives the clear
opening directly; decode only if many templates are needed. `.afx` is XML: `<tag>Open</tag><filename>Open.af</filename>`.
