# Cell placement export, version 2

`dotnet/Fo4Export` exports placement data from the user's Fallout 4 installation.
JSON stays outside this repository. Version 2 adds `schema_version: 2` at the top
level; existing `cell`, `formkey`, `refs` and placement fields keep their meanings.

Each reference retains `formkey`, original base `type`, `base_editor_id`, `model`,
`pos`, `rot`, `scale`, and the numeric `disabled` mask. Positions remain Fallout 4
units, rotations radians, and scale defaults to one. Translation into Starfield
units occurs in the plugin writer, not this export.

Additional fields preserve source state for later translators:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `base_formkey` | Original base record identity, even if resolution fails; null for a null link |
| `record_flags` | Full raw reference flags; `disabled` remains the original `0x800` mask |
| `persistent` | Reference belongs to the source cell's persistent list |
| `open_by_default` | Original default-open state |
| `enable_parent` | Reference identity and numeric enable-parent flags, or null |
| `linked_references` | Ordered links, each with `keyword_or_reference` and `reference` identities |
| `teleport_destination` | Destination door, position, rotation, flags and transition interior, or null |
| `ownership` | Owner FormKey, no-crime setting and unknown numeric field, or null |
| `faction_rank` | Optional ownership faction rank |
| `lock_data` | Lock level, key FormKey, flags and unused field, or null |

Null links stay null; an empty linked-reference list stays empty. Relationships
keep source FormKeys rather than prematurely translating them into target IDs.
`keyword_or_reference` reflects the source format's union field; do not assume
every value is a keyword. Teleport transforms also remain in source units.

The existing Starfield writer ignores these additional fields. Exporting them
does not implement enable relationships, persistent placement, teleportation or
default-open behavior, ownership or lock behavior in Starfield. VM scripts and
other unexported fields still require separate work.

`deferred_refs` retains placements outside the current object conversion path.
Actor entries keep their base identity, position/rotation/scale, raw flags,
persistent state, enable parents, linked references and ownership. Each has a
`reason` identifying why translation is deferred. Other unsupported placement
types retain at least their reference identity and type. The current plugin
writer does not consume this list; these entries do not spawn NPCs in Starfield.

Synthetic checks run with:

```powershell
dotnet run --project dotnet/Fo4Export.Tests/Fo4Export.Tests.csproj
```

They exercise the same serializer helper used by the exporter, with synthetic
references and no game installation. A separate local Vault 81 check exported
4,620 references with zero changes to the eight legacy placement fields. The new
data includes 408 persistent references, 130 enable parents, 96 references with
linked-reference lists, three default-open references and three teleport targets.
It also retains 33 deferred placements, 910 ownership entries and four locks.
These counts describe source data, not implemented gameplay behavior.
